# MLOps Architecture using MlFlow 


MLOps stands for Machine Learning Operations is a paradigm that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently.

In a scenario where a MLOps Architecture is not deploy among a team , I imagine that data scientists would have to create the model in notebooks and hand over it as an artifact to the engineering team for deployment on Cloud Service, where the deployment refers only to the model rather than the entire ML system.


Like DevOps, MLOps relies on a collaborative and streamlined approach to the machine learning development lifecycle to optimize the end-to-end activities required to develop, build, and operate workloads.

MLOps serves as the map to guide individuals, small teams, to achieve their goals no matter their constraints

In this Repository, I propose a solution where  data scientists can use their notebooks to build models using MLflow and Deploying it in Compute Engine Instances.

MLFlow is a framework that supports the machine learning lifecycle , an mlFlow Model is a standard format for packaging machine learning models , using MLFlow would help deploy , test and  monitor models.
